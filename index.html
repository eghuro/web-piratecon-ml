		<h4>Successful elections</h4>
		<p>The local elections in October 2014 were a huge success for the Czech Pirate party. X Pirates and many independent candidates under the Pirate flag were elected to local city councils.</p>
		<p>The biggest vistory was Marienbad. With 21% there is a local mayor and 2 other Pirates in the board. The coalition has decided on 6 priorities for the upcoming term: Transparent and responsible governance of the city, Participation of citizens on decision making, Quality public services, Urban development, Prevention of youth drain, Spa and tourism expansion.</p>
		<h4>International conference</h4>
		<p>An international conference is in the making for the upcoming spring. We will focus mainly on local administration and public relations issues. Apart from that, talks on running a successful campaign and Czech Pirate party organisation are possible as well as any other related topic you have in mind. Please contact <a href="mailto:international@pirati.cz">international at pirati.cz</a> to submit your ideas.</p>
		<p>Detailed information including date are to come soon.</p>
